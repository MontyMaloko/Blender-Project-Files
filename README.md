# Blender Project Files
 A Repository created as an attempt to add source control to my Blender projects, Past + Present + Future.

 In the repo, there's a file called *git-lfs-windows-v3.6.1*. Run it, afterwards, open Git Bash and run command *git lfs install*.
 This is to allow the commiting of large files onto GitHub.
